# Salobreña. The Costa Tropical

*Sun, blue skies, sea, mighty mountains - the Sierra Nevada at your fingertips, tropical vegetation is
the landscape of the Costa Tropical in the province of Granada in Spanish Andalusia. If you add to
this a hill that drops almost into the sea, studded with white houses with a Moorish castle on top,
then Salobreña.*

Salobreña is a small town of around 13,000 permanent inhabitants and is one of the most popular
holiday centers on the Costa Tropical. This part of the coast is smaller, more intimate than the
neighboring Costa del Sol to the west. The name Tropical Coast is meant to suggest higher
temperatures throughout the year. Its excellent tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 15
to 32 degrees, attracts tourists all year round.
The seaside resort area is not large, neighboring similar districts in Motril and Almuńecar. Here you
won't find the large hotels and high-rise buildings known even from the Costa del Sol. The
predominant areas are cosy two-story houses close to the beach and white terraced houses with
internal patios. It is close to everywhere. A promenade runs along the coast.

Salobreña has its origins in Phoenician times. Founded as a trading colony, it was also inhabited by
Romans and Arabs until it was recaptured by the Catholic Kings. Pirate attacks meant that the town
was surrounded by walls and its inhabitants chose safer places in the mountains.
The impressive rock is crowned by an Arab castle from the 13th century. The stone and brick walls,
towers and tower dominate the whole of Salobreña. This defensive structure was built by the
Romans and extended by the Arabs. At the foot of the Great Rock on which it stands, there are
streets with whitewashed facades, so typical of the Muslim tradition. Another interesting building is
the church of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, built on an old mosque in the 16th century.
Various districts of the town, such as La Loma, La Fuente, El Brocal and Albaycín, have medieval
corners. A walk through these areas will give the traveller an idea of what the town was like in the
old days.

The intimate beaches of Salobreña are very well-kept and have excellent infrastructure. You will
also find wilder beaches on the outskirts of the town. Salobreña also has many interesting coves.
The natural bays of El Caleton or El Pargo, which can be reached on foot, offer crystal clear water
and recreational opportunities such as scuba diving.

The Phoenicians founded the first settlement here in 800 BC and the Romans called it Manaba Sexi
Firman. Under Muslim rule, it was named Sexi Hin al-Murecab, which means "fortress of the hill" and
where its actual name derives from. In 755 AD the Omayyad Prince Aberrearán landed in the port running
away from the slaughter that the Abastes carried out in Damascus against the Omayyad family. The
following year he founded the independent emirate of Córdoba and became Emir Aberrearán I.
During the War of Granada, after Baza surrendered, Almuñecar relinquished to the Catholic Monarchs in
1489. Charles V ordered the building of a large fortress, which would be destroyed by the English in
1812 in order to expel the French troops who were defending it. In the 19th century, Turkish pirates
incarcerated the village and its people, forcing the inhabitants to flee to safer places in the nearby
mountains.

## Places of interest in Almuñecar

Castillo San Miguel

is a palace complex with an Archaeological Museum built by the Phoenicians, rebuilt and used as a
fortress by the Romans, then taken over by the Arabs of the Nasrid dynasty, which also became their
burial place. From the 16th century onwards, under the reign of the Catholic King Fernando, it underwent
reconstruction, as illustrated by the models in the Archaeological Museum. A moat, drawbridge and
imposing entrance with round towers were added. During the War of Independence with France, the castle
was ruined and used as a cemetery. In the 18th century, the castle was rebuilt and today it houses the
museum of the town of Almuñecar.

### The aqueduct and Roman baths

are the oldest and best preserved of their kind in Andalusia. The Roman aqueduct was 7 kilometres long
and was used to supply water to the town. In the first century AD when the Romans built the Brine
Factory in Almuñecar the demand for water increased, which was to be supplied by the waterworks of the
time. The aqueduct was also used to irrigate the fertile soils from the Rio Verde to the Rio Seco, where

tropical fruits were grown, and as a sewage hub. Today, the Aqueduct is made up of five parts, the longest
being 130 metres long with 17 arches and located in Torrecuevas.
The Church of the Incarnation
was built at the end of the 16th century. It is the first church in the province of Granada to end with the
Mudejar building style, most characteristic of the Andalusian region at the turn of the Medieval and
Renaissance eras. Its foundations are located on top of a Roman reservoir. During the construction of the
church, several tombs of Phoenician origin and from the 2nd century BC were found. The main chapel of
the Almuñecar church was built after the civil war that lasted in Spain from 1936 to 1939, and visits are
free.

#### Palacio la Najarra

is a neo-Arabic-style building modelled on a traditional Arab garden house. It was built in the mid-19th
century next to a former sugar factory. The phenomenal appearance of Palacio la Najarra is given by the

surrounded by a garden where cypresses and palm trees abound. It is now the headquarters of the
Municipal Tourist Board and the Municipal Tourist Information Office.

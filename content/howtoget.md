Malaga airport transfers, from Malaga to Costa Tropical, how to get to Almunecar, Salobrena, Motril. Bus
from Malaga to Costa Tropical, hotels, apartments, campings in Costa Tropical, Almunecar, Salobrena,
Motril. Airport taxi.

**Arrival**

Costa Tropical is about 100 km from Malaga airport. Closer is Granada airport (about 75 km), but there are far fewer connections to this city. 
Travelling with pets
Many airlines allow you to take your pet with you. Small animals travel on board in containers that fit under the seat. Larger ones in a special (heated) area below deck. They must travel in a special approved cage.

**From Malaga airport to the Costa Tropical**

From Malaga directly from the airport we have a convenient bus service to the Costa Tropical. You will find the bus stop just after leaving the arrivals hall. The bus (Alsa) runs along the coast and stops at all the seaside towns.
However, there are more bus connections from the main station in the city: Malaga Maria Zambramo.
We will get to the bus station (it is next to the railway station) from the airport by train (about 12 minutes). We do not need to buy a ticket from the ticket machine, we just need to insert our payment card into the reader at the gate, similarly at the exit. 
A ticket to Almuñecar, for example, costs €9 and the journey takes 1 h 45 minutes. 
We can buy tickets online and save them on our smartphone:

From Granada airport we also get to Alsa buses, changing at the bus station in this city (Estacion de Autobuses).

However, if you arrive at night you will have to think about an individual transfer. Buses do not run at night. The cost of a transfer to Almuñecar, for example, is around €100. 

**With pets**

Alsa bus lines allow pets up to 10kg to be transported, but beware: in the luggage compartment of the bus. I would like to see the CEOs of this company there. 
That leaves individual transfers. Not all taxis and other carriers agree to transport animals. You need to ask about this in advance. 
Your pet can travel by taxi in a container or cage. If it rides without, you must have a special belt, clipped to the collar and seat belt of the car. It is also worth having a special mat to pad the seat.

**Car hire**

There are a lot of car rental companies at Malaga Airport. Travelling around Andalusia in a rental car is very popular with foreign tourists. A car gives you freedom and makes travelling and sightseeing easier. However, renting a car is not as comfortable as you might think and can be expensive. We have to pay a refundable deposit, which can be as high as €2,000, in some rental companies thanks to insurance, or even not pay it. We give the rental company access to our credit card account, even at the end of the rental agreement. Regulations and rules are often unclear and full of pitfalls.

**How do you rent a car safely?**

It is worth looking at the offers of several rental companies. The lowest price on offer does not necessarily mean that it will actually be low.

Read the general rental conditions carefully.

**Pay particular attention to:**

the amount of the deposit and the deadline for its return,
whether kilometres are limited and how much the limit is,
whether there are additional charges, often a non-refundable fuel surcharge of EUR 20-40,
the terms of the basic insurance and own liability,
the possibility of additional liability insurance.

Before collecting the car, it is worth checking that there are no dents or scratches on the car body. If there are, it is worth taking a photo and reporting it to the staff. 

**With a pet**

Rental companies often do not accept pets travelling in their cars. They are concerned about the residue of dog or cat hair in the car. If you decide to travel with your pet, you should check carefully before returning the car to make sure that not even a single hair remains. This can be an opportunity for the rental company to charge extra money to our card.

Where to stay

accommodation in Costa Tropical, apartments, hotels Motril, Almuñécar, Salobreña

If you dream of all-inclusive holidays in big hotel resorts then there are better places than the Costa Tropical, such as the
neighbouring Costa del Sol. This is not to say that there are not large hotels with well-developed facilities. However, there
are very few, and in some resorts none at all. If this is an added incentive for you to come to the Costa Tropical, read on.
If you prefer to immerse yourself in the local environment from hotel life then the Costa Tropical is for you. Especially if
you like local flavours, the beauty of the landscape, the sights. Beaches too, of course, but more intimate, charming ones.
As far as tourist accommodation is concerned, flats for rent dominate here, the offer is large, but when thinking of
travelling in July and especially in August you need to book accommodation in advance. Guest houses, hostels and small
hotels, located near the sea, are also an interesting proposition. Campsites are also very popular.

Each of the Costa Tropical destinations has its own specificity. Motril is a port town, administrative and economic centre.
The town has a seaside tourist district with a rich infrastructure and nice beaches. There is also a golf course.
Salobreña is perhaps the most charming town with its castle on a rock. The town invites you for a more intimate holiday.
The infrastructure is very well developed and the town is very well maintained. Flats in small buildings and small hotels
predominate.
Almuñécar is the largest tourist centre with the most developed infrastructure. The other towns are charming, intimate
tourist destinations.
